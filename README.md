# Node-Classification-GCN-
The general working of this gcn model is to label the unknown graph nodes (documents) and connect the predicted edges(citation links) to appropriate nodes.
The model uses 2 hidden layers of gcn with 16 and 18 running units respectively.
This model uses CORA dataset that is in the steller-graph library. 
The model has a training accuracy of 99% +- (0.5%), validation accuracy of 81.33% +- (0.5%) and a testing accuracy of 83.56% +- (0.5%).
